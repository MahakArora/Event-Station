# Events Stations

Welcome to the Event Stations Project! We can 
- add new events
- delete events
- edit events
- Send newsletters

## Deployment
Deployment of the project is [here](https://event-station-2000.netlify.app/)

## Project Structure
This project is divided into two main folders:

### backend-api:

To start the backend server, run npm install followed by npm start inside this folder.

### react-frontend:

To run the React app, navigate to this folder, run npm install, and then start the development server with npm start.
Ensure both the backend and frontend servers are running simultaneously for the project to function correctly.

### Dummy Backend API
The dummy backend API serves as a simple endpoint for the React app to send and fetch data. It does not use an external database; instead, dummy data is saved to an "events.json" file inside the project folder.

### Open in Browser:

Open your web browser and visit http://localhost:3000 to access the Newsletter React application.
